# React

In this folder ReactJs is the focus, and the purpose is how to start with ReactJs in 2022.
React is not a framework, because doesn't opine in the way of structure the project.

## Project creation

usually for standard projects we use `create-react-app` but in order to be more professional I'll use a different tool:

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/tutorials/react)

### Vite with TS

`yarn | npm create vite react-tests --template react-ts`

### Vite with JS

`yarn | npm create vite react-tests --template react`

by default vite don't install the modules, s√≥ we need to run the `npm install` or `yarn` before start.

run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
